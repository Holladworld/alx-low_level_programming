# C - Preprocessor
## overview
Most new coder finds it hard understanding how codes are being compiled. I am among the new coder. Well, C language has been a little difficult for me to understand and every time i find myself learning new topic in C I usually have to spend hours on it before I could digest what its more about. 
In this task, I feel priviledge because right from the introductory stage to C language from [hello world](https://github.com/Holladworld/alx-low_level_programming/tree/1df32075655b47eeca8c91040c72fc3d8b6f974b/0x00-hello_world), I already gotten familar with preprocessor. This might be one of those tasks I completed without seeking for assitance.

## What is preprocessor?
Wiki say "The C preprocessor is the macro preprocessor for the C, Objective-C and C++ computer programming languages" Too complicated right? Let check out Tutorial Point "a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation".

Let me simply say, its a pre compiliation that occurs before the actual source code compilation that allows you to define macros(piece of code defined with the help of the #define directive) that transforms your program before it is compiled. More complicated? It shouldn't be. 

# Task 
* 0-object_like_macro.h: create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE
* 1-pi.h: create a header file that defines a macro named PI
* 2-main.c: program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from
* 3-function_like_macro.h: function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number
* 4-sum.h: function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
