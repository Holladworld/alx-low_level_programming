Project done during **Full stack Sofware Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**

## Technologies

* C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
* C files are written according to the C90 standard 
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:
