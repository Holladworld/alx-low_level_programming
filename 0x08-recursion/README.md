![Banner](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/c-recursion_0.jpg)

In C programming, if a function call itself from inside the same function, it is called recursive.

## Overview
This project is about solving some tasks using Recursive function

## Task

0. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
*FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

1. Write a function that prints string in reverse

2. Write a function that return length of a string

3. Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

4. Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

5. Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

6. Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7. Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

8. Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
